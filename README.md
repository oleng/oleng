### üëã  Hey, there, welcome! 


I suppose you've found this from my CV or LinkedIn, or maybe you're just lost? Thank you for checking this out anyways!    
Little summary of me, I :heart: Python and Docker, and currently pursuing data engineering career.

You can read a bit more about me [here on my github page](https://oleng.github.io/about), 
and although there's currently not much in it, I also have some entries in the [blog](https://oleng.github.io/), 
made with hugo & [continuously deployed by Github Action's workflow](https://github.com/oleng/oleng.github.io/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/hugo.yml)    
You can reach me via email or my twitter @deadvoid. üí¨ Talk to me about whatever!

Feel free to look around! For example, check these out:    
- [oleng/Dockerfiles: source for Dockerhub builds](https://github.com/oleng/dockerfiles)     
- [oleng/solved: repository on coding challenges](https://github.com/oleng/solved)

_Props for other interesting projects I really like ‚≠êÔ∏è that might be relevant/interesting to you_:


| Repo | Note |
|-----|:-----|
| [Hashicorp Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault) |           I'm starting to integrate this into my dev after (too) long period of hesitation! |
| [Dagster](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster) |                I'm getting into this at the moment (Expect a setup repo later!) since I'm not too keen on deep diving in Airflow yet, at least until their next major release. |
| [Airflow boilerplate](https://github.com/ninja-van/airflow-boilerplate) | Pretty good template to start setting up (current version of) Airflow! |
| [FastAPI docker](https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-docker) | I'll show a project using this soon, promise üòÖ |
| [DuckDB](https://github.com/cwida/duckdb) |                       Sqlite for OLAP, `pip install duckdb` & use pandas API-like syntaxes. So cool! |
| [Certbot](https://github.com/certbot/certbot) |                   Absolutely no reason not to use this for something as essential as HTTPS certs management |
| [fluent-bit](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit) |              I need to start integrate this Log processor and forwarder soon! |
| [Arq](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/arq) |                      another _soon i'll find a reason to use this_ library |
