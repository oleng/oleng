### ðŸ‘‹  Hey, there, welcome! 


I suppose you've found this profile from my CV or LinkedIn, or maybe you're just lost? Thank you for checking it out anyways!     
I'm currently looking for opportunities in data engineering.

My interests:    
- Open Source Softwares 
- Workflow orchestration 
- CI/CD 
- Containers
- Secrets management
- Observability
- Automated data processing, provenance/lineage, and discovery as data platform

You can read a bit more about me [here on my github page](https://oleng.github.io/about), 
and although there's currently not much in it, I also have some entries in the [blog](https://oleng.github.io/), 
made with hugo and [continuously deployed by Github Action's workflow](https://github.com/oleng/oleng.github.io/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/hugo.yml)    
You can reach me via email or my twitter @deadvoid. ðŸ’¬ Talk to me about whatever!

Feel free to look around! For example, check these out:
